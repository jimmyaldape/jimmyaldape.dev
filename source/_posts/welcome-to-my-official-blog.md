Hi! My name is Jimmy. Welcome to my official blog. It's been a long journey so I have a lot to say but for now I will mostly be rambling about things I learn in development with a little photography sprinkled in between. I'm not the smartest of the bunch, but I do know how to use google and ask questions. If you like what you read, please follow me on twitter [@jimmyaldape](https://twitter.com/jimmyaldape). Thank you.
