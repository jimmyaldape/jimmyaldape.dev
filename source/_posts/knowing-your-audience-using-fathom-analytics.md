You've finished and deployed your website.  You've marketed and funneled users to your site.  Now you decide to gather some analytic data so that you can know your audience.  Naturally you decide to go with the goliath of analytics, Google, after all that's all you've heard about and know. However, you're at a crossroad.  Privacy matters to you but you need to know your audience. You also know Google Analytics is powerful but complicated. What do you do? Do you submit and compromise? Enter david, [Fathom](https://usefathom.com/), the simple, light-weight, privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics.

### What is Fathom?
Fathom is a simple, light-weight, privacy-first alternative to Google Analytics. It helps you collect analytics you need to run your business without compromising or breaking rules. It only gives you what you need like your top content, top referrers and other useful data without collecting personal information.  I repeat, it does not collect personal information. There are no annoying cookies and is compliant with GPDR, ePrivacy, PECR, CCPA, and COPPA.

### Fathom on the Move
Up until now, I've only used Google Analytics for paid work, but each time the foundation was always pre-setup.  The data I would receive honestly felt intrusive.  Privacy matters to me. Too many companies know too much about us. I knew there had to be a better way. As a software engineer, my first thought was to roll my own solution. As an experienced software engineer, I knew better.  Through my Twitter feed, I heard about Fathom and its analytics product. It sounded promising.  However, I wasn't ready to commit since my personal projects were not going to be developed any time soon. Still, I added [@jackellis](https://twitter.com/JackEllis) to my following list. Each tweet or mention kept me intrigued.

It wasn't until Jack penned the blog post titled, "[Someone attacked our company](https://usefathom.com/blog/ddos-attack)"
that I decided it was time. It was obvious they had stepped on giant toes and proved that people/entities? were taking notice.
So I set my plan in motion, hoping I could become a customer sooner rather than later.

### Fathom Cost
Fathom is not free, but they do have a 7-day free trial. The plans are based on usage and are as follows:

- $14/month - 100,000 page views
- $24/month - 200,000 page views
- $34/month - 400,000 page views
- $44/month - 800,000 page views
- $54/month - 1,000,000 page views
- $74/month - 2,000,000 page views
- Contact them for +2,000,000 page views


The great news is that it allows for tracking of unlimited websites at any price point and if you go over they state:

*" If you go over your page views, we will never suspend or close your account, or stop tracking your website. Instead, we look at a 2 month rolling average (where you greatly exceed your plan both months) and email you when weâ€™re upgrading your plan, based on consistent overages, not just occasional traffic spikes.
No long-term contracts, cancel anytime. "*

It just keeps getting better.

### Fathom Future
Not to be out done, Jack and Paul, [announced](https://usefathom.com/v3) already that v3 update was just around the corner. To name a few, they will be bringing a new refreshed design, ability to filter content, IP and Country blocking, UTM parameters for instance filtering campaigns, and many more.

### Getting Started
Getting started is fairly easy.  You create a username and password, and provide credit card information.  Don't worry, it will not charge you.  The first 7 days are free. Once your account is created, you will be able to add your first site.   When you add your site, it will immediately give you the code you need to tack your site.  It will also allow you to test right then and there that it can see your site. Luckily, I have my pipeline setup through Netlify and am able to make the changes, commit to my repository, and merge for deployment to production.  Within a minute or two my site was live, and I was ready to test. I tested the site and was blown away that I could already see the data.

### Data
As you can see in figure 1, the data presented is exactly what you would need to make informed business decisions.

### Summary
With Fathom, you no longer need to compromise. Privacy focused, the platform is fast, the data is easy to digest, and more importantly, free of Google dependence. You can now find out about your audience and make informed business decisions without feeling guilty. I can't wait for v3 as I know it will continue to slay the giant.
