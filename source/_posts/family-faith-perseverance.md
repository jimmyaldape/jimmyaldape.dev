snippet: Ever since my dad bought me my first computer at the age of 12, I was hooked. I knew I wanted to do something with computers but did not know what or how to accomplish it.  I excelled in school in many subjects but like many seniors in high school, I fizzled.  I joined the military and went to college.  However, having no support or resources I could realistically tap into, I dropped out of college and started to work in IT. It was during this time I realized I wanted to become a software engineer, but the fact of the matter is, life happened.

Ever since my dad bought me my first computer at the age of 12, I was hooked. I knew I wanted to do something with computers but did not know what or how to accomplish it.  I excelled in school in many subjects but like many seniors in high school, I fizzled.  I joined the military and went to college.  However, having no support or resources I could realistically tap into, I dropped out of college and started to work in IT. It was during this time I realized I wanted to become a software engineer, but the fact of the matter is, life happened.

I got married to a beautiful and courageous woman, had two wonderful girls, and gave my life to the Lord. With a growing family, I realized I needed to do something different. Frustrated with limited advancement opportunities and not making enough to support my family properly, I decided enough was enough and had to do something about it. So I "cast my cares" to God and went to work.

While working at my full-time job, I went back to college and got a second part-time job. Looking back, I don't know how I did it. In class, I would look around at my younger classmates and think, "I'm too old for this." I sometimes resented the fact that they had no cares other than school, while I sat here trying to catch up on the previous nights homework while thinking about what to feed my children. Sometimes I had to choose between taking a final or doing my job, studying or spending time with my young children, eating or buying school supplies.  I failed a few classes because I just did not have the time or energy to study. Every day was a battle that I thought I was losing over and over, but I never gave up - I persevered.

Apart from studying, working, and taking care of my family, I took tutorials, read books, asked questions to those who would listen, and practiced, practiced, practiced software development. Eventually I started to implement working solutions with code at my full-time job to improve our workflows but because I was not an "official" software engineer or developer, I was not taken seriously and dismissed.

The only thing that kept me going was my family and my faith. When I would look into the eyes of my little ones, no matter how bad of a day I had, it all seemed to melt away. I realized God had my back, was giving me the strength, and even gave me my own precious little audience. It gave me the perspective and energy that no words could effectively describe - it had to be felt.

After a few arduous years, I finally received my degree. Fast-forward today, I am now a software engineer not only on paper but in practice. Although it was a long journey, I would not have it any other way. I am thankful for the obstacles I faced.  I am thankful for the hard lessons I learned. I am thankful for it all. Through family, faith, and perseverance, I overcame, and it has made all the difference.

Thank you for reading.
