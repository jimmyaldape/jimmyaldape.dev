It's been a long journey to get to where I'm at now. There's been many times I questioned what I was doing, and many more days sitting here just defeated.  I went back to school after gaining experience in the Army and the IT workforce to get a computer science degree. I had always wanted to become a software engineer. I loved coding and could do it all day, but the fact of the matter is, life happened. 

Having no financial support and a growing family to take care of, I had to do what I had to do.  So for 10+ years I just worked in a dead end IT job so that I could take care of my family. Every chance I had, I was taking tutorials, reading books, and practicing.  I'd even implemented working solutions at my job with code but because I was not an official software engineer or developer I was not taken seriously.  

Frustrated with no advancement opportunities, not making enough to support my family properly, I decided enough was enough and had to do something about it. So I gave everything to God and went to work. I worked a few jobs while going to school full-time. Sometimes I had to choose between taking a final or doing my job, studying or spending time with my young children, eating or buying school supplies, you get the idea.  It was a battle that I thought I had lost over and over but I never gave up - I persevered. 

The only thing that kept me going was my faith and my family. When I look into the eyes of my little ones, no matter how bad of a day I had, it all melted away and gives me a new perspective and energy that really can't be effectively described - it has to be felt.

After a few years, I finally received my degree. So here I am now a software engineer and it has made all the difference. So if you have read this far, I apologize for my rambling. If you can relate or are struggling to make it - be encouraged.  It can and will be done. Keep pushing. Keep fighting. Don't give up. Thank you for reading.
