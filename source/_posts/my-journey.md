You may or may not be interested, but it's been a long journey to get to where I'm at. There's been many times I questioned what I was doing and many more days sitting here just defeated.  You see, I went back to school in my mid 30's to get a computer science degree. I so desperately wanted to become a software engineer. I thought the only way to achieve this was to go back to school. Of course now I know that isn't always the case. I loved coding and could do it all day, but the fact of the matter is, life happened. 

Having no financial support and a growing family to take care of, I had to do what I had to do.  So for 10+ years I just worked in a dead end IT job so that I could take care of my family. Every chance I got, I was taking tutorials or reading books.  I'd even implemented solutions at my job with code but because I was not an official software engineer or developer, I got passed over and over for promotions.  

Frustrated with no advancement opportunities, not making enough to support my family properly, I decided enough was enough and had to do something about it. So I gave everything to God and went to work. I worked a full-time job, a part-time job, and went to school full-time all at the same time. Sometimes I had to choose between taking a final or doing my job, studying or spending time with my young children, eating or buying school supplies, you get the idea.  It was a battle that I thought I had lost over and over. However, I never gave up. The only thing that kept me going was my love for Jesus and my family. When you look into the eyes of your little ones and no matter how bad of a day you had, it all melts away and gives you a new perspective and energy that really can't be effectively described - it has to be felt.

Anyhow after 5 years of a 4 year program, I received my degree. So here I am now a software engineer and it has made all the difference. So if you have read this far, I apologize for my rambling. If you can relate or are struggling to make it - be encouraged.  It can and will be done. Keep pushing. Keep fighting. Don't give up. Thank you for reading.
